<h3 style="font-family:courier;"> What made you get into programming?</h3>

<b style="font-family:courier;">John.</b> <p style="font-family:courier;">A desire to learn how to think more effectively is partially what brought me to study
and practice programming but also an interest in deeper computer science concepts like
abstraction, meaning, language, and solvability</p>

<b style="font-family:courier;">Kylon.</b> <p style="font-family:courier;">Videogames and social media are big contributors to me getting into programming. 
At an early age, I was interested in computers and gaming consoles and how they operated. Between trying 
to get my MySpace the newest wallpaper and learning how videogames are able to be read to a gaming console 
and then projected to a TV, it became clear that coding was an essential aspect of what I enjoyed to do 
practically every day. The question was how do I get involved?

<b style="font-family:courier;">Justin.</b> <p style="font-family:courier;">Orignally, I was on the path to become a Civil Engineer. Midway through my first year, I realized
that the Civil Engineering path was not for me. Growing up, I always had an interest in computers,
so I started looking into the plethora of programing languages available. The summer after my first year,
I learned the basics of python3 and that turboed the interest in programming. I love the satisfaction that one gets
from completing a project. I also love that programming gives an individual the ability to automate computer life.</p>

<br>
<h3 style="font-family:courier;">What are your future plans?</h3>

<b style="font-family:courier;">John.</b> <p style="font-family:courier;">My future plans include owning a small rammed-earth house on a plot of land full of
unique, rare plants</p>

<b style="font-family:courier;">Kylon.</b> <p style="font-family:courier;">My future plans are to be involved with programming in some form or fashion. At this 
point, programming is a hobby but it would be a dream come true to turn programming into a career. 
First, is the understanding though; understanding the different languages will make any programmer 
a multi-faceted weapon that is able to serve the needs of many employers. That's my mindset moving 
forward as I pursue the education route.</p>

<b style="font-family:courier;">Nathaniel.</b> <p style="font-family:courier;">FillIn</p>

<b style="font-family:courier;">Justin.</b> <p style="font-family:courier;">My future plans include continuing on the path of computer science and gaining a degree 
of competency in order to get into the Artificial Intelligence field.</p>

<br>
<h3 style="font-family:courier;">Top three qualities about yourself</h3>

<h3 style="font-family:courier;">What is your favorite thing about the Interactive Planner?</h3>

<b style="font-family:courier;">John.</b> <p style="font-family:courier;">I love that it is our own creation, something we will know from the inside out.
There is a very appealing degree of intimacy involved with creating your own software,
it seems to me.</p>

<b style="font-family:courier;">Kylon.</b> <p style="font-family:courier;">Speaking from hindsight, the Interactive Planner was a great choice for a project one. 
The reason I say this is because of the mental challenge posed, at least for me. When the group got together 
and began brainstorming details about the interactive planner I was intimidated. Databases, Tkinter, and GUI's 
were foreign concepts to me, at least until group members began pointing the way and sharing more information about 
the project. Now, I have created and managed my own local database that is a small piece to a much bigger machine. 
I found that very cool!</p>

<b style="font-family:courier;">Nathaniel.</b> <p style="font-family:courier;">Fill In</p>

<b style="font-family:courier;">Justin.</b> <p style="font-family:courier;">My favorite thing about the Interactive Planner is that the entire project is one big 
combination of all of our skills put together. Everyone is able to bring their own insight and ideas to 
the project while also being able to bounce ideas off of each other. In the very beginning, learning about 
all of the different methods this project needed, SQL and the TKINTER library, was very intimidating,
but being able to talk about these topics with my partners made taking this project a lot easier than I had
originally thought.</p>

<h3 style="font-family:courier;">What is your favorite food?</h3>

<b style="font-family:courier;">John.</b><p style="font-family:courier;">Navy bean soup in the Winter and ratatouillie in the Summer</p>

<b style="font-family:courier;">Kylon.</b> <p style="font-family:courier;">Soul food is my favorite style of food, but nothing compares to
 a warm bowl of Pozole when it's cold outside.</p>

<b style="font-family:courier;">Nathaniel.</b> <p style="font-family:courier;">Fill In</p>

<b style="font-family:courier;">Justin.</b> <p style="font-family:courier;">Vietnamese pho will always be my go to for comfort food</p>

<br>
<h3 style="font-family:courier;">Are you a dog person or a cat person</h3>

<b style="font-family:courier;">John.</b> <p style="font-family:courier;">Both cats and dogs have their benefits but - dogs</p>

<b style="font-family:courier;">Kylon.</b> <p style="font-family:courier;">Dog person. I own a black German Shepherd; her name is Luna</p>

<b style="font-family:courier;">Nathaniel.</b> <p style="font-family:courier;">Fill in</p>

<b style="font-family:courier;">Justin.</b> <p style="font-family:courier;">Personally, I am a dog person. The energy that someone can get from a dog
cannot be matched by a cat. I have a German Shepherd mix and her name is Boba because her fur
reminded me of the color of milk tea.</p>
